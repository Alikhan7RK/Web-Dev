        <p class="post">Today I started learning HTML! It's really cool. I learned how to make headings with h1 to h6 tags. I also learned how to make paragraphs with p tags. The teacher said we will learn CSS next week. I can't wait to make my websites look better!</p>

        <p class="post">This week I made my first webpage! It was about my favorite football team. I used images from the internet and made a table. I also learned how to change colors with CSS. My webpage looks simple but I'm proud of it. Next I want to learn how to make links to other pages.</p>
