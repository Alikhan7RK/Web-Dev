    <h1>Between the steps</h1>
    <p>A quiet thought, a restless mind, <br>
        Dreams run ahead, doubts lag behind <br>
        Between the steps, i learn to see <br>
        Who i was, and who i'll be
    </p>

    <p>
        Each day a spark, each night a sign- <br>
        The path is mine, the time is mine.
